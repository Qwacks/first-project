        <h1>Jared</h1>
        
        <p>My name is Jared Johnson. I'm a senior in the Design program, and definitely NOT the Batman. I spent the first few years of uni swapping my majors out. I've gone from Mechanical Engineering to VCD, with a Philosophy minor to boot. I hope to get outta here by next fall and to discover what real life actually entails. My bucketlist contains stuff like "Dock a blimp at the Empire State Building" and "Riding in a hot air balloon"</p>

       <p>My favorite book is <cite>The Tropic of Cancer</cite> by Henry Miller. I chose this one because it is the book I last read. I enjoyed the book for it's classical feel mixed with a content and style that makes it feel so alive. </p>
