        <h1>Jared</h1>
        
        <p>My name is Jared Johnson. I'm a senior in the Design program, and definitely NOT the Batman. I spent the first few years of uni swapping my majors out. I've gone from Mechanical Engineering to VCD, with a Philosophy minor to boot. I hope to get outta here by next fall and to discover what real life actually entails. My bucketlist contains stuff like "Dock a blimp at the Empire State Building" and "Riding in a hot air balloon"</p>

       <p>My favorite book is <cite>The Tropic of Cancer</cite> by Henry Miller. I chose this one because it is the book I last read. It's a statement about freedom of speech, and was banned from the U.S. for a long while after it was published. I enjoyed the book for it's classical feel mixed with a content and style that makes it feel so alive. </p>

             <h2>Chicken Burrito</h2>
                     <br>
               <p>I am a burrito man. This large tortilla filled with salsa, beans, cilantro lime rice, and chicken is a great meal if you're on the go or just want to avoid washing utensils.</p></li>

             <h2>Pineapple Fried Rice</h2>
             <p>Fried rice is always good, and whenever I get thai food I always ask for Pineapple Fried Rice. This goes fantastically with the generally spicy thai classics, and is easy to cook at home.</p></li>

             <h2>Grilled Cheese</h2>
             <p>Practically the easiest thing to make besides PB and J, grilling your sandwhich brings unlimited options to the table. Tomatoes, bacon, onions and garlic. You can add anything to enhance this classic.</p></li>
